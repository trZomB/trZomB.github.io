    <p class="bodyBoxLeft">This is legtimately the best portfolio website I have ever made in my life. The extent of
        my web design knowledge: a little bit of HTML5, CSS3, and JS6 written up in Visual Studio Code. I don't really
        know what else I would do besides embed some voice clips and add some images but does it really need much more
        than that? Probably not.</p><br>

    <p class="bodyBoxRight">Not sure if I need to have more than one page for a website like this. If I did I'd be
        tempted to use iframes so everything loads within the first page. Do people still use iframes these days or is
        it obsolete now? It's been ages since I used them, way back in Macromedia Flash days. Good days. Bring back
        Windows XP. </p><br>
